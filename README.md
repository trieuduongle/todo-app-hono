# TODO App

## Used Technology/Libraries

- Honojs
- Drizzle ORM
- Cloudflare Worker + D1 database
- React

## How this repo is initilized:

1. npx create-turbo@latest
2. cd apps && npm create hono@latest todo-api
3. update the name + version of package.json in todo-api folder. Then Turbo will know that app immediately
4. Do similar things to setup React app.
5. At root folder, call "npm run dev", it will call "dev" task in all apps+packages folder( I think so)

## Using this example

Run the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Maybe you will receive some error at first time, so just use README file in each app to setup before call "npm run dev" once again

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```

# Future Works:

- Prepare pipeline to deploy to Cloudflare/Supabase ...
- Improve frontend to better structure when call backend
- Make things configurable through .env or wrangler.toml ...
  (Will update more ...)
